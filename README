R/Websockets
A simple, portable HTML 5 Websocket API implementation for R.

Significant changes in package version 1.1.0:
- We rebuilt the package from the ground-up, removing the dependency on the
  libwebsockets C library, and instead implementing the websockets protocol
  mostly in R.
- The older IETF-00 protocol supported by the previous package versions
  as well as newer protocols up to at least -15 are now supported.
- All features related to "cookies" have been removed. Sorry if this breaks
  something. It's easy enough to replicate that functionality directly in R.
- Each websocket server has an R environment associated with it. The environment
  contains a list of connected client websockets and all other data required
  by the server.
- Otherwise we try to maintain syntax compatibility with previous package
  versions.
- There are new functions for serving static web pages from files or strings.
- The license has changed from GPL-2 to LGPL-3.
